	<h1>Biggest Heading</h1>
	<h2>subtitle</h2>

	<p>As of late, I've been listening to a lot of podcasts. Whether it be "Podcast P" with NBA superstar Paul George or "The Deep 3 Podcast", basketball has always been on my mind. And something lately that is always recurring is a style of narrative and discussion that ESPN feeds off of so greatly.  Constantly, people all over social media have been discussing these Journalists. Does Stephen A. know more about basketball than the average benchwarmer on an NBA team? I mean after all, Stephen A. is a famed and world-renowned sports panelist who makes a hell of a living off of people listening to what he has to say, no matter how ridiculous. But he was exposed greatest by former NBA sharpshooter JJ Reddick. Reddick in his discussion with Stephen A. while discussing Superstar Giannis Antetokoumpo was questioning his actual "basketball IQ". Stephen A. was constantly making a point of how "numbers don't tell anything". When JJ Reddick revealed that Jimmy had shot a lower percentage from the mid-range than Giannis, Stephen A. blew this off simply as "people are praying he takes those chances...he's shooting the jump shot because they are so petrified of him going to the basket... numbers don't tell every story." Much like JJ Reddick, the average NBA fan would be questioning this rant by Mr A. He talks about Giannis and basketball in a way that is beside the entire point. He talks about him not by statistics, but simply just by his feelings and what he believes is true. Many people understand Giannis's danger in the post, but the analytics proved that Giannis does have a jump shot. His shooting ability without contest is dangerous enough that he draws defenders out to guard him. This allowed the Bucks to keep the ball moving, and as soon as Giannis dished it out to one of the shooters, they could either pull up or slash to the rim, resulting in easy points. He again received controversy for his statement on how players approach Jordan vs how they approach Lebron. He stated "You don't mess with MJ...with Lebron you believe you can take him...you just view him differently." his main idea on this point was that Lebron lacked a fear factor. JJ once again refuted what he said, and made the point of how he had played against Lebron, something Stephen A. has never come close to. And he, as an NBA player, knew that people did fear Lebron. Lebron is one of the greatest players of all time, and to say people did not fear him while at one point averaging over 30 ppg is outrageous. What Stephen A. made a point of is aside from the physical and technical aspects of the game, instead talking about factors outside, such as the "fear factor". Stephen A. is a gifted journalist, but not for being knowledgeable about the actual game. He is famed for his controversial takes and his "general" sense of basketball. He is good at challenging and confronting others on their takes while lacking the knowledge that such panelists as former NBA players like JJ Reddick have. Another panelist who was a victim of confrontation was Skip Bayless. Former Mavericks owner Mark Cuban came at him. In the interview, Cuban states that the wording these sports writers use such as "excruciating pressure", which Skip stood by saying that Lebron had faced the biggest collapse of a superstar ever in the finals. Cuban discusses how they used wording such as "Miami wanted it more." He rejected this statement, as it wasn't like OKC did not want it more. Cuban stated "In terms of adjustments and changes now if you want to start to talk about double teams and how they were used whether or not they should have played zone what defensive structure was in place that's a valid conversation but you're saying they wanted it more that's ridiculous okay when you get to when you Kevin Durant and you're Derek Fisher and you're Russell Westbrook etc and you're at that closeout game there's nobody that wants it more it's just a question of who executes better." Skip once again with his excessive knowledge of the game stated "Lebron played harder than Kevin Durant, Miami played harder than OKC." The interview continues with Mark continuing to make valid points about the game of basketball while Skip kept talking in a way that if you heard, you would assume they did not know how the sport of basketball worked whatsoever. Skip Bayless talks like how a WWE announcer talks. There are no statistics in these arguments, he just says what he thinks and uses fancy wording to construct his responses and takes. Playing harder is a ridiculous statement, and Skip offers no substance in his claims, just using a general way of expressing his ideas without showing any real understanding of the game and statistics.

	<p>The famous and popular discussion of "Who's the GOAT?". A question that frequents barber shops is the main star of most of the media most people consume these days.<p>
	<div class="image" id="Lebron"></div>
<p>Famous ESPN commentators such as Stephen A. and Skip Bayless, feed off of and generate commentary through their heated rants.</p>
	<div class="image" id="kobe"></div>
 <p>These people have become famous due to their outlandish nature and generate ESPN views and circulation through their debates. But is this the right commentary people should be listening to? For the average Joe who enjoys listening to arguments about petty things such as the GOAT debate, sure. But for people who listen and breathe the sport? This type of discussion is not the type that helps or improves people's opinions and ideas on basketball.</p>



		<p>The sports media has been consumed with these kinds of journalists and kinds of takes and has deprived the sport and the people who watch of truly knowledgeable discussions. The latest introduction of the "Mind the Game with Lebron James and JJ Reddick" podcast has brought basketball back to its strength. They discuss the game with terminology coaches and players use, such as different plays drawn up how best to react to zone defense, and what kind of shots should be taken. They also take into consideration how much they hate the idea of a "bag", which can't be defined. Actual basketball is a game of 5v5, not 1v1. He reaffirms that "if you have an opportunity to have a favorable matchup and you can beat your man but realize something most great teams are going to send help and can you make the right reads can you make the right reads can you instill confidence in your teammates to when you've scored twice on that favorable matchup do you know that the double is coming and you have to see it either coming from the tilt on the baseline or from the fire from the nail". Everything that the sports media has consumed and put upon the watchers is being refuted by actual masters of the game that people like Stephen A. and Skip Bayless profit off of so much. Hopefully, more podcasts like this will come out, and hopefully, the narrative of basketball that companies like ESPN follow can be changed for the better, so that future generations can learn the correct way and not the Stephen A. way.
