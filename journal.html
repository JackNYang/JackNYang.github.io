<h1>First week of CS1, I have written a lot of code</h1>

<p>How to add to my website:</p>

<h1>2nd week of CS1, we learned to make Icons for our websites</h1>
<p>Go to codepen.io and it will allow you to make your icon.</p>

<h1>I was missing one day because I had doctors, so I'm going to assume this is the 4th week.</h1>
<p>Made a console, Obama turned into big Obama</p>

<h1>I wrote a code about my Gratitude gift for a friend, and it was gonna be for my Dad but the photos were lowkey embarassing</h1>

<p>I am making a code like a slot machine or random machine that chooses a random person</p>

<h1>I have learned about RGB, which was pretty cool as adjusting the coordinates can help me achieve different types of colors</h1>

<h1>Clothes option code
	I spent a long time figuring this one out. The tricky part was that I had to make a way so that once the close did appear, it would appear where the cursor was, because it would be very annoying if it didn't. I had to use a lot of code to even make the clothes appear in the first place, and get it to disapear. You don't want to wear two different shirts, do you? I took inspiration from the pizza code but I eventually worked mine out to make it different.</h1>
<h1>Car Code
	My favorite car is the porsche 911 gt 3, and thankfully the website provides a 360 view of the card. Using that as well as event listeners, I was able to make the car move around. I even added a horn to add a drift tone to it.</h1>
<h1>Appreciation card
	I looked through my camera role, and saw that I had many funny pictures of Johnny. I then put it into a slide show and gave each picture a number, and the event listener would add 1, and when mod the amount of pictures I can get each picture to show. I then used my initial event listener to incorporate a sound to play as soon as it starts, and not to stop until it ends. This was a very fun presentation to complete.</h1>
<h1>Jumpscare
	I didn't want to do anything corny like adding an actual monster, so I used a gif of Lebron James laughing. Then I added a track of the joker laughing, which is pretty unsettling. Then I added a simple event listener for the sound to play when I click, switching from the regular background to a horrific sight of King James laughing.</h1>
<h1>Kevin Durant and Duncan Robinson
	I used an event listener so that when Duncan Robinson was selected, his image id would switch to that of Durant. I did these two since the NBA posts profiles of their players, and it was easier to find matching sized pics then make them compatible.</h1>
<h1>Slot Machine
	I made a div for each image, and I used a math equation so that it would give 3 different number values. Since each image had their own number id, it would show whichever number when rounded up it would be closest to. Thus I made a slot machine. a
