	<p> <span id="mvptext">What makes an MVP?</span> Well, by definition, that commands the meaning of the most valuable player. But is this the correct metric by which we choose the player who receives this honor? For example, during the 2012-13 season, Lebron James dominated. He led the Miami Heat to the 1 seed with 66 wins, including a 27-game win streak, only beaten by a record attained at the time by Jerry West and Wilt Chamberlain. People recognized Lebron as the best player, and he led his team to the best record. This commanded him to win most people's #1 MVP vote. This was the year he would be recognized as the first-ever unanimous MVP. Yet there was one slight problem;  
	</p><p><div class="image" id="mvp"></div></p><br><br>
	<p>Carmelo Anthony had somehow attained a first place vote. Carmelo was nowhere close to the caliber of player that James was, and he led his team to a 2nd seed behind James' Heat. But the reporter Gary Washburn of the Boston Globe selected him for one reason: I voted for Carmelo Anthony based on his importance to the New York Knicks, who, if you haven't been paying attention the past decade, have failed to be relevant." <p>
	<div class="image" id="melo"></div>
<p>Washburn, a reporter for a city James had so often terrorized, might've just done this out of spite. But this raises the important question of what makes an MVP, and what makes the Most Valuable Player? While James made the Miami Heat marginally better, his partners in crime of "The Big Three," comprised of him, Bosh, and Wade, were all all-stars in their own right. The Knicks didn't just have scrubs, either. Melo came into a system with All-NBA Amar'e Stoudemire, DPOY candidate Tyson Chandler, 6 moty conversation J.R. Smith, and an aging but still graceful Jason Kidd running the point. However, Melo's support was not like that of the Heat, and although James was clearly the better player, with higher win shares on the court and an overall season score higher than that of Melo. But the conversation comes into importance. The Knicks were not in the conversation for the 2 seed without Melo; Melo made them championship contenders. But does his importance to the Knicks make him an MVP contender? Without a doubt, Lebron James was the better player. If you put Lebron on that Knicks squad, he would still be who he is, and would that justify him even more? These are the questions we are faced when considering what makes an MVP. Most people will lean toward the best player on the best team, as it was their performance that got their team to the 1st seed. Notable cases of Karl Malone, Steve Nash, and Magic Johnson. These players were the focal point that led to their team clinching their seeds. They might not have been the best in the league, but the evidence was there; their performance led to their team being the best. And that was value. This was how MVPs were decided for a while until a PG that liked to rock the baby decided to explode. And yes, I'm talking about Russell Westbrook. After losing his partner in crime, Kevin Durant to the team that eliminated them, Russ was out for revenge. As a primary option on an OKC team looking for a leader, the Brodie burst out for 31 ppg, 10.7 rpg, and 10.4 apg. He became the first player since the Big O to average a triple-double for an entire season. His performance led his team to the 6th seed in a stacked eastern conference. Although he did not meet the criteria previously associated with what an ideal MVP is, his stats and performances were just too good to overlook. This was repeated in 2022 when Nikola Jokic won the MVP award after dragging an injury-rattled Nuggets to the 6th seed. His stats? 27.1 ppg, 13.8 rpg, and 7.9 apg. Again, much like Russ, although his scoring was tied to winning, his stats and overall importance to the Nuggets being able to carry them to the 6th seed made him most valuable to the franchise, and for that reason, he garnered the MVP award. While I find it unfair how MVPs are given out, there still is the idea of narrative to it. What a player faces throughout the year, the struggles and turmoil they must overcome, are all taken into consideration. But the MVP is always going to be and always has been subjective, so for now, all we can do is pray that our player does enough(Luka Magic) to garner it without needing to average 50(Luka Magic).</p>

 <p>These people have become famous due to their outlandish nature and generate ESPN views and circulation through their debates. But is this the right commentary people should be listening to? For the average Joe who enjoys listening to arguments about petty things such as the GOAT debate, sure. But for people who listen and breathe the sport? This type of discussion is not the type that helps or improves people's opinions and ideas on basketball.</p>



		<p>The sports media has been consumed with these kinds of journalists and kinds of takes and has deprived the sport and the people who watch of truly knowledgeable discussions. The latest introduction of the "Mind the Game with Lebron James and JJ Reddick" podcast has brought basketball back to its strength. They discuss the game with terminology coaches and players use, such as different plays drawn up how best to react to zone defense, and what kind of shots should be taken. They also take into consideration how much they hate the idea of a "bag", which can't be defined. Actual basketball is a game of 5v5, not 1v1. He reaffirms that "if you have an opportunity to have a favorable matchup and you can beat your man but realize something most great teams are going to send help and can you make the right reads can you make the right reads can you instill confidence in your teammates to when you've scored twice on that favorable matchup do you know that the double is coming and you have to see it either coming from the tilt on the baseline or from the fire from the nail". Everything that the sports media has consumed and put upon the watchers is being refuted by actual masters of the game that people like Stephen A. and Skip Bayless profit off of so much. Hopefully, more podcasts like this will come out, and hopefully, the narrative of basketball that companies like ESPN follow can be changed for the better, so that future generations can learn the correct way and not the Stephen A. way.
